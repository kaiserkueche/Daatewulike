1. Overpass API Query for All Municipalities with Boundaries and Node Labels:

We will use an Overpass API query that fetches municipality boundaries (relations) and nodes (points) with the French names.

Overpass API Query:
[out:json][timeout:120];
area["name"="Alsace"]["boundary"="administrative"]->.a;

(
  relation["admin_level"="8"]["boundary"="administrative"](area.a);  // Fetch municipalities as relations (boundaries)
  node["admin_level"="8"]["name:fr"](area.a);  // Fetch nodes with French name for municipalities
);

out tags geom;

What this query does:

area["name"="Alsace"]->.a; – Fetches the area of Alsace.

relation["admin_level"="8"]["boundary"="administrative"](area.a); – Retrieves municipalities' relations (boundaries) within Alsace.

node["admin_level"="8"]["name:fr"](area.a); – Retrieves nodes for municipalities, which may represent central points with the French name (name:fr).

out tags geom; – Outputs all the tags (such as the French name) and geometries for both relations and nodes.

2. Importing the Data into QGIS:

Install QuickOSM in QGIS if you don't have it already.

Open QGIS and launch QuickOSM (found in the Processing Toolbox).

Paste the Overpass API query into the Custom Overpass Query box.

Click Run to fetch the data.

You should now have a layer that includes:

Municipality boundaries as relations (polygons).

Municipality points as nodes (with name:fr label).

3. Styling the Map in QGIS:

Styling the Boundaries:

Right-click the municipality boundaries layer (relations).

Go to Properties > Symbology.

Set the fill color and border color as you like (choose a subtle color for the boundaries, e.g., light gray or transparent fill).

Adjust the line thickness.

Styling the Nodes:

Right-click the nodes layer (points).

Go to Properties > Symbology.

Choose Marker symbol and set a size and color (you can use a small circle or a custom marker).

Adding Labels (French Names):

Right-click the nodes layer > Properties > Labels.

Under Label with, select the name:fr field to label the nodes with French names.

You can adjust font size and placement (e.g., "over point" or "above point") for the labels.

4. Export to SVG:

Once you have styled your map with both municipality boundaries and labels, you can export it as an SVG file.

Go to Project > Export > Export Map to SVG.

Choose the resolution and other export settings.

Click Save.

5. Optional: Additional Tips for SVG Customization:

In QGIS, you can manually adjust the SVG file to add specific style elements, such as line thickness or font style, using a text editor or vector graphic software like Inkscape.

If you have a large dataset and need to optimize it for use on websites or print, you might want to simplify the SVG paths or adjust the viewBox to fit all elements nicely.
